A spallation facility systems code
In the style of PROCESS from CCFE which calculates performance and costs for fusion facilities, this is a smaller scale code aiming to do a similar job for spallation facilities

The objectives are to choose between different accelerator options, proton beam energy, number of target stations, target station designs & number of instruments etc to produce costs, performance and other operational parameters.

At present this is work in progress, answers are not proven to be meaningful in any way shape or form.
